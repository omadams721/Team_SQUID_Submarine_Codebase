# Team_SQUID_Submarine_Codebase
This repository contains the software stack for an intelligent submersible vehicle developed as part of a robotics course project. The goal of the project is to design and implement an autonomous underwater system capable of propulsion, sensing, communication, and actuation in a challenging aquatic environment.
